Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible code that implements a certain algorithm. You can read more about [code golf on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

This website features some code golf problems and solutions that I solved using JavaScript. You can select from a list of problems from the list on the left. You can read a description of the selected problem under the [Problem] tab. You can test the solution in the [Solution] tab. You can take a look at the JavaScript source code in the [Source Code] tab.
